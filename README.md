# ✈️ Hello! I'm Joaoddoliveira

**`Learning to Fly Planes and Predict the Future`**

I'm currently a second-year student at the Faculty of Science of University of Porto, studying Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. I enjoy the challenge of creating small algorithms and working on projects related to Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, especially when they involve real-world problem-solving.

Alongside my academic journey, I hold a frozen ATPL license with 200 total flight hours. My favorite aircrafts are the Cessna 172, where I built my foundation, and the Airbus A320, on which I’ve completed my MCC (Multi-Crew Cooperation) training. Aviation and tech may seem worlds apart, but I find both require the same mindset: precision, analysis, and calm decision-making under pressure.

👨‍💻 Joao's Coding Journey

I've always been driven by curiosity, and my first contact with programming was during high school through Scratch. That’s where I began learning the basics of logic and how to think computationally. At university, I was introduced to Python in an introductory course, and I started completing daily challenges on CodeWars to improve my skills and problem-solving. During the first year of my Artificial Intelligence and Data Science (IACD) degree, I worked on several hands-on projects involving AI and data analysis, applying what I learned to real-world scenarios.

In addition, my experience in aviation has helped immensely in shaping my way of thinking and problem-solving. Aviation taught me to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable blocks and to handle multitasking efficiently, skills that translate directly to programming and algorithm development.

I know there's still a lot to learn, but I keep working with focus and dedication, aiming to master Python and create useful applications and algorithms — whether to improve my daily life or make a meaningful contribution to society.
